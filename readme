To develop a react app with redux:
  1. Map all the actions our app will have. Example:
    Add
    Remove
    Request
    Repsonse
    View
    The actions are all the moves the user will do, that change the state of the app.
    Add changes the state, adding a new record (writing the state).
    View changes the state showing the records (reading the state).
  2. Map our app using the actions we have.
    Create the components that are going to use the state.
    Depending in the nature of the component, connect them to redux using:
      mapStateToProps: Connects part of the state with the component's props. Example:
          const mapStateToProps = state => {
            return { articles: state.articles };
          };
        It only uses the articles attribute of the state. This is used when you want
        to show some part of the state ot the views (reading).
      mapDisptachToProps: Connects reduce actions to react props. Example:
          const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
            return {
              addArticle: article => dispatch(addArticle(article))
            };
          };
        Creates a function that takes an article for later adding to the state,
        The function passed to dispatch should be an specified action, in this case
        addArticle(article), returns an object with de action ADD_ARTICLE.
        The name of the function is addArticle.
